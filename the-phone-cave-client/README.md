# DESCRIPTION

This is a tech challenge practice done in the context of the ironhack preparation for our job hunt.

This was the first tech challenge I took and in 3 hours I had to build a REST API with two endpoints 
/phones GET Show all phones (use the phones.json) as fake data
/phones/:id GET Show a phone details

Then on the front end I had to display the list of all phones, and on the same page, the details of each phones.

I had to create both the REST API and the REACT API within these three hours.

CSS was left for the end, the requirements were to have a responsive website that doesn't look "too bad". I decided to adopt a minimalistic layout.
However I did not have time to implement a spinner to display while the data is loading.

# INSTRUCTIONS
No particular instructions, you will need to configure the port on your machine.
Don't forget about the packages ;)
